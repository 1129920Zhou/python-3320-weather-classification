# python-3320-weather-classification
 classification of weather
this project use CNN to train the data and the dataset is retrieve from kaggle.
to accelerate the running speed, I will put the train data to cache, the speed will be much faster
I will also plot a diagram to show accuracy and loss
it will generate a link to get a gui for the weather classification
